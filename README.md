##Simple Card Battle Program with Object Oriented
Text based Card match battle.

This is a card game where two players compete against each other. Each player has a parameter called HP (health points) and a deck of cards. The cards have two parameters: attack and defense. The goal is to reduce your opponent's HP to zero.

At the beginning of each turn, both players draw three cards from their decks. These cards have different attributes, such as attack and defense. Players can see their own cards, but not their opponent's cards.

During a player's turn, he or she selects a card from his or her hand to attack the opponent. The attack power of the selected card is compared to the opponent's defense. If the attack power exceeds the defense power, the opponent's HP is reduced by the difference. If the opponent's defense is higher, no damage is dealt.
